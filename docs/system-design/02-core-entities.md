## 2. Entity Definitions

### Customer
Represents an end user who owns vehicles and makes appointments. Staff and Admin users are also stored in this table, differentiated by the `role` field.

| `password_hash` | VARCHAR(255) | bcrypt hash, never returned in API responses |
| `role` | VARCHAR(20) | `CUSTOMER` (default) \| `STAFF` \| `ADMIN` |
| `dealership_id` | UUID FK → Dealership (nullable) | Set for `STAFF` users; null for `CUSTOMER` / `ADMIN` |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | |

---

### Vehicle
A vehicle owned by a customer that can be brought in for service.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `id` | UUID PK | |
| `customer_id` | UUID FK → Customer | |
| `make` | VARCHAR(50) | e.g. Toyota |
| `model` | VARCHAR(50) | e.g. Camry |
| `year` | SMALLINT | e.g. 2021 |
| `vin` | VARCHAR(17) | Unique Vehicle Identification Number |

### ServiceType
A catalogue of services, each with a fixed duration and required technician skills. Service types may be scoped to a specific dealership or shared globally (nullable dealership).

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|

| `dealership_id` | UUID FK → Dealership (nullable) | Null = global service type available at all dealerships |
| `name` | VARCHAR(100) | e.g. "Full Engine Overhaul" |
| `description` | TEXT | |
| `duration_minutes` | INT | Fixed service duration |
| `required_skills` | TEXT[] | e.g. `["engine", "electrical"]` |

> **Design note**: `required_skills` is a PostgreSQL text array. An index on the GIN
> operator allows efficient `@>` (contains) queries when matching technician skills.

### ServiceBay
A physical workspace within a dealership. One vehicle at a time.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|

| `status` | ENUM | `CONFIRMED`, `CANCELLED`, `COMPLETED` |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | |
| `cancelled_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Nullable |

#### Status Transitions

```
  [request]
  ──────► CONFIRMED ──[time passes]──► COMPLETED
               │
               │ [customer cancels]
               ▼
           CANCELLED
```

> **Design note**: Booking attempts that fail (no bay, no technician, or concurrent lock
> collision) are rejected immediately with a `409` response. No record is persisted for
> failed attempts.
